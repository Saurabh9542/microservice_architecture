I developed a video to MP3 converter using a microservices architecture. The backend was built with Python and Flask, with MySQL used to store user data and RabbitMQ to send notifications between services. I leveraged MongoDB with GridFS to handle video storage, enabling the system to efficiently store and manage files larger than 16MB. The entire system was deployed locally using Minikube on Kubernetes, ensuring scalability and streamlined operations.
